# React mouse follower

A simple website showcasing a mouse following bubble that reverses the colors on hovered headers so that they are always visible. Upon click it reverses the colors of the whole website creating a smooth transiton.

This effect would be ideal for a landing page to get the users attention right away and show some interesting JS and CSS tricks.
